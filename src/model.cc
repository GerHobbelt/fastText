 * @brief
 * The predict or inference process. This process consists of two stages. 
 * The first stage is calculation of "hidden vector" mentioned in 
 * `Model::computeHidden`, this gives out an average embedding vector. 
 * The second stage is inference step with given hidden average embedding 
 * vector. This process is executed by `loss_`, which is an Loss instance, 
 * such as a `SoftmaxLoss` instance. The reason of this design is the 
 * second stage will be execute both during inference and forward-propogate 
 * during training, so put it into loss instance can let this step has 
 * reusability.
 *
 * @param input The input of the model, which is a `std::vector<int32_t>` 
 *   instance, each element is a token, which is one of text's word and 
 *   char n-gram bucket id, these ids will be used to query each token's 
 *   embedding vector in embedding vector dict(matrix).
 * @param k TODO: What's this meaning?
 * @param threshold TODO: What's this meaning?
 * @param heap TODO: What's this meaning?
 * @param state This used to holding "hidden state" info, isee details in `Model::State::State`.
